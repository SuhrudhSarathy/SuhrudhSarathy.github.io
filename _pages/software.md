These are some of the projects that I have been a part of. All my projects can be found cd[here](https://github.com/SuhrudhSarathy)

# Drone Navigation

I developed a ROS navigation stack for an Autonomous drone using RotorS Simulator. Major focus of this project was on implementing RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) in a 3D unmapped environment. To percieve the environment, I used Point Cloud data from the Depth Camera and processed it using Point Cloud Library.

Take a look at the [post]() accompanying the project to know the exact details of the project.

# Gennav

Gennav is a python package intended to serve as a one stop destination of navigation algorithms. This was developed as a part of a club project. We divided the package into `planners`, `controllers`, `envs` and `utils`.

- `planners` : Contains Path Planning algorithms. It is further divided into
  - `potential_field`
  - `prm`
  - `rrt`
- `controllers` : Contains controllers for omniwheel drive robot and a differential drive robot
- `envs` : Contains environments that facilitate effective collision checking.
- `utils` : Contains some utility functions and classes

The project was further extended to construct a ROS Wrapper on top of Gennav, called `gennav_ros`.

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
