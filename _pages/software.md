These are some of the projects that I have been a part of. All my projects can be found [here](https://github.com/SuhrudhSarathy)

# Drone Navigation

I developed a ROS navigation stack for an Autonomous drone using RotorS Simulator. Major focus of this project was on implementing RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) in a 3D unmapped environment. To percieve the environment, I used Point Cloud data from the Depth Camera and processed it using Point Cloud Library.

Take a look at the [post](https://suhrudhsarathy.github.io/posts/2020/10-auto-drone-nav) accompanying the project to know the exact details of the project.

# Gennav

Gennav is a python package intended to serve as a one stop destination of navigation algorithms. This was developed as a part of a club project. We divided the package into `planners`, `controllers`, `envs` and `utils`.

- `planners` : Contains Path Planning algorithms. It is further divided into
  - `potential_field`
  - `prm`
  - `rrt`
- `controllers` : Contains controllers for omniwheel drive robot and a differential drive robot
- `envs` : Contains environments that facilitate effective collision checking.
- `utils` : Contains some utility functions and classes

The project was further extended to construct a ROS Wrapper on top of Gennav, called `gennav_ros`.

To install `gennav`
- From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/gennav.git
cd gennav
python -m pip install .
```
- Using pip
```bash
python -m pip install gennav
```

# Trotbot
Trotbot is a robot designed to serve as a delivery robot in an indoor environment. The deliverables will be placed inside the container. It will be able to autonomously navigate around obstacles and reach waypoints set in and around its environment. Identification tags will be used by the Bot to locate the rooms and localize itself.

Since we were stuck at home due to the pandemic, [Omnibase](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/omnibase) was released to test our algorithms in simulation.
