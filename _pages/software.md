These are some of the projects that I have been a part of. All my projects can be found cd[here](https://github.com/SuhrudhSarathy)

# Drone Navigation

I developed a ROS navigation stack for an Autonomous drone using RotorS Simulator. Major focus of this project was on implementing RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) in a 3D unmapped environment. To percieve the environment, I used Point Cloud data from the Depth Camera and processed it using Point Cloud Library.

Take a look at the [post]() accompanying the project to know the exact details of the project.

# Gennav

Gennav is a python package intended to serve as a one stop destination of navigation algorithms. This was developed as a part of a club project. We divided the package into `planners`, `controllers`, `envs` and `utils`.

- `planners` : Contains Path Planning algorithms. It is further divided into
  - `potential_field`
  - `prm`
  - `rrt`
- `controllers` : Contains controllers for omniwheel drive robot and a differential drive robot
- `envs` : Contains environments that facilitate effective collision checking.
- `utils` : Contains some utility functions and classes

The project was further extended to construct a ROS Wrapper on top of Gennav, called `gennav_ros`.

python -m pip install .
```
- Using pip
```bash
python -m pip install gennav

# Trotbot
Trotbot is an indoor autonomous Robot that is capable of autonomously traversing between waypoints avoiding obstacles. It uses a 2D-Lidar for localisation and obstacle avoidance. It is omnidirectional and hence can move more freely in constrained indoor environments.
