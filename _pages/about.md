Hello! I am Suhrudh. I am a third year Undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics. I am a Robotics Enthusiast and my primary interests lie in __Path Planning__, __State Estimation__ and __Perception__. I am also interested in Computer vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

I am currently interning with [Ottonomy](https://www.ottonomy.io) where I am working on developing alogrithms for effective 2.5D planning. I have previosly interned at [Peppermint](https://www.getpeppermint.co) where I worked on developing a __Graphical User Interface__ for Robots and integrating it with ROS2. I also worked on __Local Planning using Motion Primitive based Planner__. I am also currently working under [Prof. Shibu Clement](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/shibu/profile) for a __Drone Mapping of Mangrove Swamps in Goa__.

I also am the __President__ of [Center for Techincal Education](https://twitter.com/CTEBPGC), BITS Goa. I lead a motivated team of 30+ people and conduct courses, workshops, events for the students of BITS Goa. I am also a part of __Electronics and Robotics Club__ and the __Aerodynamics Club__ of BITS Goa.
