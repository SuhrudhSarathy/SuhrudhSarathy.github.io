Hello! I am Suhrudh. I am a Final year Undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics. I am a Robotics Enthusiast with primary interests in __Motion Planning__ for Autonomous Robots.

I am currently working at [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) as a Research Intern for my Undergraduate Thesis co-supervised by [Prof. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) and [Prof. Debashish Gosh](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/). I am working on developing navigation algorithms for Heterogenous swarm of robots in Agriculture settings.

Previously, I interned at [Peppermint Robots](https://getpeppermint.co/), [Ottonomy](https://ottonomy.io/), [Black Coffee Robotics](https://www.blackcoffeerobotics.com/) where my work primarily focussed on developing navigation algorithms and simulation techniques. I also had the privelage to work under [Prof. Rakesh Warier](https://bits-pilani.irins.org/profile/230526) for a semester project.
