Hello! I am Suhrudh. I am a Robotics Engineer working at [Peppermint Robotics](https://getpeppermint.co/) where I build autonomy software for industrial service robots. I recently early-graduated from [BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics. 

I pursued my Undergradate thesis from [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in) where I was co-supervised by [Prof. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) and [Prof. Debashish Gosh](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/). I worked on developing navigation algorithms for Heterogenous swarm of robots operating in Agriculture.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I pursued various internships and projects in Robotics. Here are some of my [projects](https://suhrudhsarathy.github.io/projects/), my [teaching](https://suhrudhsarathy.github.io/teaching/) experience and my [CV](https://suhrudhsarathy.github.io/exp/).

My research interests lie in the fields of Motion Planning and Behaviour planning in general. In my free time I try to read and implement algorithms that I found interesting. I also recently started working with the Rust programming language and am currently trying to develop more open source code.
