Path planning is one of the most important primitives for autonomous mobile robots. The ability to be able to travel on its own by finding a collision free, optimal path is an important aspect of making robots autonomous. Path, as the name suggests is a set of waypoints which a Robot is expected to travel. There can be many criterions for deciding a path that the Robot should follow. Various optimisations, checks are made before deciding an optimial path.
