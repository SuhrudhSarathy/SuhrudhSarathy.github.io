Sampling based Path planning algorithms suffer for optimality and convergence issues. Algorithms like RRT*, Informed RRT* etc. are said to asymptotically optimal; i.e. the algorithm converges to optimal solution as the number of samples tend to infinity. But there is no proper gaurentee given about the rate of convergence. To improve the rate of convergence, algorithms like BIT* perform heuristically guided search to converge faster towards optimalitily.
