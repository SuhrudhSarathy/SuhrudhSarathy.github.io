Sampling based Path planning algorithms suffer for optimality and convergence issues. Algorithms like RRT*, Informed RRT* etc. are said to asymptotically optimal; i.e. the algorithm converges to optimal solution as the number of samples tend to infinity. But there is no proper gaurentee given about the rate of convergence. To improve the rate of convergence, algorithms like BIT* perform heuristically guided search to converge faster towards optimalitily.

[Here](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/blog/blog/heuristically_guided_sampling_based_path_planning/) is the link to the blog post I wrote more on this.

I also gave a talk on __Sampling based Algorithms__ at Paper Discussion Sessions as a part of Club activities at the Electronics and Robotics Club. The links to the presentation and the recordings are given below
